* Revisit multi-dispatch of propertyChange events for binding (in PropertyEvent.dispatchChange)

* Consider implementing IMerging in ValueObjects - BE sure to make clone, merge and equals available globally

* refactor bind to move applyOnly out and property-updates in.

* review to see if a Config can be made into an implicit singleton (for instantiation and auto-complete)

* update history with correct bindings.
* update history to have a currentTotalPosition and totalLength (or similar)
* update history to reset combining upon execution of a command that does not match the currentTotalPosition (eg, undo has occured)



* add global config property that references Config.main

fix CommandItem (commands don't require constructor args anymore)

* update DomainController so it can be instantiated 100's of times and still point to the same data.
 (all properties are stored globally)
* allow model to be referenced from DomainController as a single (global) property

*fix Arguments with index and optional=true/false

*update DomainModel to take out it's innards - making it a static VO class edit tool (move VO and IVO into the same package)

√ create base EventDispatcher (just in time, ondemand) outside of VO (called FlightDispatcher for now)


√ make dynamic object a proxy (removed DynamicObject until its use becomes more clear)

√ add some semblance of hierarchy to Config ... merge=true merges it to its parent, and to the global. (taken care of with Object MXML classes)
clean up Config
