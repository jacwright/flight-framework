*complete entire list solution

* Revisit multi-dispatch of propertyChange events for binding (in PropertyEvent.dispatchChange)

* Consider implementing IMerging in ValueObjects - BE sure to make clone, merge and equals available globally

* refactor bind to move applyOnly out and property-updates in.

* review to see if a Config can be made into an implicit singleton (for instantiation and auto-complete)

* update history with correct bindings.
* update history to have a currentTotalPosition and totalLength (or similar)


* update history to reset combining upon execution of a command that does not match the currentTotalPosition (eg, undo has occured)
*delete the worthless config property in utils
*fix config solution
