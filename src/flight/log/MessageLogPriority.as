	 * These priorities are always available, and a convenience method of the same name is available for each one.
	 * The priorities are not arbitrary. They come from the BSD syslog protocol, which is described in RFC-3164. 
	 * The names and corresponding priority numbers are also compatible with other logging systems, promoting 
	 * interoperability.
	 * 
	 * Priority numbers descend in order of importance. EMERGENCY (0) is the most important priority. DEBUG (7) 
	 * is the least important priority of the built-in priorities. You may define priorities of lower importance 
	 * than DEBUG. When selecting the priority for your log message, be aware of this priority hierarchy and choose 
	 * appropriately.
